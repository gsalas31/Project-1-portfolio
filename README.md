## Project Description

My project will consist  on a main landing page with different sections including: about me, projects, skills and contact info. It will allow user to have different versions adaptable to web, phone and iPad. It will provide a well balanced color combination for a better experience and a hamburger menu that will increase usability and/or flexibility. Images, icons and background will serve to complement the overall outcome. I will leave this link used as an inspiration for my hamburger menu. https://www.dcfonts.com/

## Code Snippet



## Issues and Resolutions
Jquery :I encoountered some problem trying to merge links with projects and the best way was to proceed step by step instead of tryin to solve everything within a single line. 
CSS: An issue with CSS will be that is very time consuming when adding mediaqueries and try making your website responsive to every single device. Resolution: being patient and test your resutls or work with dev tools.
