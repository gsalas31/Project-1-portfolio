## Project Description

My project will consist  on a main landing page with different sections including: about me, projects, skills and contact info. It will allow user to have different versions adaptable to web, phone and iPad. It will provide a well balanced color combination for a better experience and a hamburger menu that will increase usability and/or flexibility. Images, icons and background will serve to complement the overall outcome. I will leave this link used as an inspiration for my hamburger menu. https://www.dcfonts.com/
