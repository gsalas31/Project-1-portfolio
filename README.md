## Project Description

My project will consist  on a main landing page with different sections including: about me, projects, skills and contact info. It will allow user to have different versions adaptable to web, phone and iPad. It will provide a well balanced color combination for a better experience and a hamburger menu that will increase usability and/or flexibility. Images, icons and background will serve to complement the overall outcome. I will leave this link used as an inspiration for my hamburger menu. https://www.dcfonts.com/

## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Do not include the actual image and have it render on the page.  

- [Mobile] https://res.cloudinary.com/g31ssa/image/upload/v1595045981/pic2_gug3ew.jpg
It will be divided in 3 to 4 sections. First part will navigation bar and logo, followed by image and About me title. Second section will consist on images of projects. Last but not least form. Everything will be displayed as a column.

- [Tablet] https://res.cloudinary.com/g31ssa/image/upload/v1595045995/pic1_phxlnv.jpg
Tablet wont be far different from mobile and both will have hamburguer menu. 

- [Desktop] https://res.cloudinary.com/g31ssa/image/upload/v1595045989/pic3_ahyj9t.jpg
For desktop site, items will be equally distributed horizontally rather than vertically. Wont have hamburguer menu.

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.
